{"text": "Dismissal / Other Penalty - If there has been further misconduct or failure to improve performance since a final written warning the Company may dismiss the employee or take some other action short of dismissal such as demotion or disciplinary suspension. The employee will be provided with a written statement of the reasons for dismissal/or other action, the date on which the employment will terminate (if dismissed), and their right to appeal, as soon as reasonably practicable. The dismissal decision should only be taken by a manager who has the authority to do so. \n\nDismissal without Notice - If the Company establishes that there has been gross misconduct the employee may be summarily dismissed i.e. dismissed without notice. The Company will follow a fair disciplinary procedure before taking any decision to dismiss without notice and this will be confirmed in writing (see Gross Misconduct section below).\n\nAppeal", "metadata": {"doc_id": "bae4e527-386b-42c6-b4de-52d8f6202de3", "source": "Disciplinary-Policy-and-Procedure.docx", "chunk_id": 14, "categories": ["conduct", "discipline"], "section": ""}}
