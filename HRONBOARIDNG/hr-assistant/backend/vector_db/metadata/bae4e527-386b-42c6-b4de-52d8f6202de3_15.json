{"text": "Appeal\n\nEmployees have the right to appeal against any formal disciplinary action. An appeal cannot be made against an informal oral warning. The appeal should be made in writing within [insert amount] working days of the disciplinary decision. \n\nThe employee must inform the Company as to the grounds for appeal in writing, and may be accompanied to the appeal meeting. In making an appeal, the employee should state if they are appealing against the finding that they committed the alleged acts of misconduct and/or against the level of sanction imposed. \n\nThe Company will hear the appeal without unreasonable delay and where possible the appeal will be dealt with by a manager, preferably more senior, not previously involved in the case. However, where this is not practicable, the same manager may handle both the disciplinary and the appeal meetings and he/she will act as impartially as possible.", "metadata": {"doc_id": "bae4e527-386b-42c6-b4de-52d8f6202de3", "source": "Disciplinary-Policy-and-Procedure.docx", "chunk_id": 15, "categories": ["conduct", "discipline"], "section": "Appeal"}}
