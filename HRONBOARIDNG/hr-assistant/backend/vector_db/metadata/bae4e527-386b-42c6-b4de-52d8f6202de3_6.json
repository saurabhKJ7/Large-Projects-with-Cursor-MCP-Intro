{"text": "The main purpose of the informal talk is to find a solution to the problem that is beneficial for both the Company and the employee.\n\nGenerally, cases of minor misconduct and/or unsatisfactory performance are dealt with informally. In the event of poor performance, disciplinary meetings will usually only be undertaken where counselling the employee and further training (if required) has failed to produce a satisfactory improvement to performance. However, if the informal action does not provide a solution to the problem or if the disciplinary issue is too serious to be dealt with informally, then the formal disciplinary procedure will be followed.\n\nWritten Notice of Intended Disciplinary Meeting", "metadata": {"doc_id": "bae4e527-386b-42c6-b4de-52d8f6202de3", "source": "Disciplinary-Policy-and-Procedure.docx", "chunk_id": 6, "categories": ["conduct", "discipline"], "section": ""}}
